<img height="60px" src="release/logo.png" align="left">

⚠️ This addon does not contain RaspberryMatic ⚠️

This addon acts as a proxy to an external running RaspberryMatic instance. 
The sole purpose of this addon is to add a RaspberryMatic icon to the sidebar of Home Assistant which will open the frontend of an external running RaspberryMatic instance.

## Options

- `server` (required): this should be the local URL on which the RaspberryMatic frontend is running, e.g. `http://192.168.2.43:80`. Make sure there is no trailing slash!
